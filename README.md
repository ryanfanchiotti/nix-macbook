## Nix flake for MacOS

Personal configuration for my MacBook \
\
**Notes:** \
Homebrew needs to be installed separately \
Icons on dock don't appear after first build but they will on following builds \
Install Nix with the [Determinate Systems installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) without the `--determinate` flag \
Manage system using [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin)
